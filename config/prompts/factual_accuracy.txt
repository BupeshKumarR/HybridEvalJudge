You are an expert fact-checker evaluating the factual accuracy of an AI-generated text.

**Source Text (Ground Truth):**
{source_text}

**Candidate Output (To Evaluate):**
{candidate_output}

**Retrieved Context (if available):**
{retrieved_context}

**Task:**
Evaluate the factual accuracy of the Candidate Output against the Source Text and any Retrieved Context.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify Claims**: Break down the Candidate Output into individual factual claims.
2. **Verify Each Claim**: For each claim, determine if it is:
   - SUPPORTED by the Source Text or Retrieved Context
   - REFUTED by the Source Text or Retrieved Context
   - NOT_ENOUGH_INFO (cannot be verified from available information)
3. **Detect Hallucinations**: Flag any claims that are not grounded in the Source Text or Retrieved Context.
4. **Assign Score**: Based on your analysis, assign a factual accuracy score from 0 to 100:
   - 0-20: Mostly false or hallucinated content
   - 21-40: Significant factual errors
   - 41-60: Mix of accurate and inaccurate information
   - 61-80: Mostly accurate with minor errors
   - 81-100: Highly accurate and well-grounded

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**
Think step-by-step through your evaluation. For each claim:
- State the claim explicitly
- Identify supporting or contradicting evidence
- Explain your verdict
