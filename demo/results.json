  "question": "What are the early warning signs of Type 2 diabetes? List the main symptoms.",
  "reference": "Type 2 diabetes symptoms often develop slowly. Common symptoms include:\n- Increased thirst and frequent urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Unintended weight loss\n- Fatigue and weakness\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow-healing sores or frequent infections\n- Numbness or tingling in hands or feet\n- Darkened skin areas, usually in armpits and neck",
  "response": "Type 2 diabetes has several early warning signs:\n1. Increased thirst and frequent urination - Your body tries to flush out excess sugar\n2. Increased hunger - Cells aren't getting enough glucose for energy\n3. Fatigue - Without proper glucose metabolism, you feel tired\n4. Blurred vision - High blood sugar affects the lens of your eye\n5. Slow healing - High blood sugar impairs circulation and immune function\n6. Tingling in extremities - Nerve damage from prolonged high blood sugar\n\nThese symptoms develop gradually and may be mild at first.",
