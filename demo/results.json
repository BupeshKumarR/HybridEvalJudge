Increased hunger - Cells aren't getting enough glucose for energy\n3. Fatigue - Without proper glucose metabolism, you feel tired\n4. Blurred vision - High blood sugar affects the lens of your eye\n5. Slow healing - High blood sugar impairs circulation and immune function\n6. Tingling in extremities - Nerve damage from prolonged high blood sugar\n\nThese symptoms develop gradually and may be mild at first.",

However, the Source Text is not provided for direct comparison, so the evaluation is based on general medical facts. The symptoms listed, such as increased thirst and urination, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing, and tingling in extremities, are commonly recognized as early signs of Type 2 diabetes. The explanation for each symptom is also largely accurate, reflecting the underlying physiological changes associated with the disease.",
